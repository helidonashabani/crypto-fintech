### Write a shell script exe.sh that:
1. Generate a new address A (a shell variable)
2. Generate a new address B (a shell variable)
3. Mine 100 blocks whose rewards go to A
4. Set as shell variables:
	(a) UNSPENT: the first unspent transaction output (utxo)
	(b) txid: the transaction id of UNSPENT
	(c) vout: the output value of UNSPENT
	(d) scriptPubKey: the scriptPubKey of UNSPENT
	
	
### Exercise 4.3 
    example1.js nodejs script which sets up new address using bitcore
### Exercise 4.4 
    example2.js executes a standard transaction with bitcore
    example3.js adds data to a standard transaction
    example4.js generates JSON for transaction

### Exercise 4.5 
    freeze-st.js //demonstrate a freezing fund transaction i.e. A sends 10 BTCs to B but it is unspendable until 150 blocks later

### Exercise 5. 
    args-regtest.js //parses arguments from bash too JS
### Exercise 5.1 
    freeze.js //executes freezing funds while taking arguments from bash
